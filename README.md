## 📄 About

This project is refactored from the original [**dev-portfolio**](https://github.com/Smilesharks/dev-portfolio) project, thanks for his work.

I use iconify instead of SVG icons for better dev experience.

Thanks for antfu's cool animations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Use this Repo as an Astro Project Template

- I use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) as my package manager.

# Initialize the project
```bash
pnpm create astro@latest --template shinigami-it/about.fujiwaratofu.shop
```

### 1-1. Clone the repo
If you don't want to use the template command, you can clone this repo and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shinigami-it/about.fujiwaratofu.shop.git
cd about.fujiwaratofu.shop
pnpm install
```

### 2. Add Your Content:

Edit the `cv.json` file to create your own printable Portfolio/CV.

### 3. Launch the Development Server:

```bash
# Enjoy the results
pnpm dev
```
1. Open [**http://localhost:4321**](http://localhost:4321/) in your browser to view the result 🚀

### 4. Customisable colours:
Change the data-theme of `cv.json` and choose one of the colour themes defined in theme.css, red, blue, green, cyber, pink and default, with its variants in dark mode, or create your own.
